        Initializes Neuron class:
            1. Weights - How much influence this input has on the overall outcome
            2. Bias - Added to the weighted sum of inputs. Helps shift activation Fn when weighted sum = 0.

        '''
        Params:
            inputs - an array of features (should be an np array for dot prod)

        Returns:
            The weighted sum as a float value.

        Functionality:
            Calculates the total weighted sum of all neuron inputs + the bias term,
            which can later be passed to an activation function.

            Weighted Sum: z = w1 ⋅ x1 + w2 ⋅ x2 + ...+ wn ⋅ xn + b

        weighted_sum = np.dot(self.weights, inputs) + self.bias
        return weighted_sum
